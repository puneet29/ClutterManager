# Clutter Manager

**If you are a clumsy guy like me who clutters up their filesystem with all sorts of files, then this tool is for you.**

Clutter Manager sorts all the files inside the folders according to their respective types and makes an Index for all the files for easy searching.

## Usage

1. Clone Directory

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/puneet29/ClutterManager.git
    ```

2. Change directory

    ```bash
    cd ClutterManager
    ```

3. Run ClutterManager

    ```bash
    python3 main.py --root <path to any clumsy directory>
    ```
